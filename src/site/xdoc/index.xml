<section name="Commons RDF">

  <p>
    Commons RDF aims to provide a common library for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/">RDF 1.1</a>
    that could be implemented by the upcoming versions of the main Java toolkits
    (<a href="http://jena.apache.org/">Jena</a> 3.x and <a href="http://openrdf.callimachus.net/">Sesame</a>
    4.x) as well as for other libraries (<a href="http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/">OWLAPI</a>,
    <a href="http://clerezza.apache.org/">Clerezza</a>) and other JVM languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main motivation behind this simple library is revise an historical incompatibility
    issue. This library does not pretend to be a generic api wrapping those libraries,
    but a set of interfaces for the RDF 1.1 concepts that can be used to expose common
    RDF-1.1 concepts using common Java interfaces. In the initial phase commons-rdf
    is focused on a subset of the core concepts defined by RDF-1.1 (URI/IRI, Blank Node,
    Literal, Triple, and Graph). In particular, commons RDF aims to provide a type-safe,
    non-general API that covers RDF 1.1. In a future phase we may define interfaces
    for Datasets and Quads.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A draft diagram of the interfaces which may be included in Commons RDF are:

<section name="Release Information">
<p>There is currently no stable release of Commons RDF. You may: </p>
  
  <!-- TODO comment in, after first release
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/rdf/download_rdf.cgi">1.0</a></li>
<li>Read the <a href="release-notes/RELEASE-NOTES-1.0.txt">1.0 release notes</a></li>

<section name="Getting Involved">
<p>
The <a href="mail-lists.html">commons developer mailing list</a> is the main channel of communication for contributors. Please remember that the lists are shared between all commons components, so prefix your email by [rdf]. </p>
<p>You can also visit the #apache-commons IRC channel on irc.freenode.net or peruse <a href="issue-tracking.html">JIRA</a>.</p> 
<!-- TODO we could create these special jira marker versions for RDF as well, if it make sense
Specific links of interest for JIRA are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideas looking for code: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20LANG%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%22Patch%20Needed%22%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC">Patch Needed</a></li>
<li>Issues with patches, looking for reviews: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=fixVersion%20%3D%20%22Review%20Patch%22%20AND%20project%20%3D%20LANG%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC">Review Patch</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively you can go through the <em>Needs Work</em> tags in the <a href="taglist.html">TagList report</a>.</p>
<p>If you'd like to offer up pull requests via GitHub rather than applying patches to JIRA, we have a <a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/">GitHub mirror</a>. </p>

<section name="Support">
<p>
The <a href="mail-lists.html">commons mailing lists</a> act as the main support forum.
The user list is suitable for most library usage queries.
The dev list is intended for the development discussion.
Please remember that the lists are shared between all commons components,
so prefix your email by [lang].
</p>
<p>
Bug reports and enhancements are also welcomed via the <a href="issue-tracking.html">JIRA</a> issue tracker.
Please read the instructions carefully.
