/**
 * A simple in-memory implementation of the Commons RDF API.
 * <p>
 * This package contains a simple (if not naive) implementation of
 * {@code org.apache.commons.rdf.api} using in-memory POJO objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that although this module fully implements the commons-rdf API, it
 * should <strong>not</strong> be considered a reference implementation. It is
 * <strong>not thread-safe</strong> nor scalable, but may be useful for testing
 * and simple usage (e.g. prototyping).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use this implementation, create an instance of
 * {@link org.apache.commons.rdf.simple.SimpleRDF} and use methods like
 * {@link org.apache.commons.rdf.simple.SimpleRDF#createGraph} and
 * {@link org.apache.commons.rdf.simple.SimpleRDF#createIRI(String)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.apache.commons.rdf.simple.Types} class provide constant
 * {@link org.apache.commons.rdf.api.IRI}s of the common RDF XML datatypes.
 * </p>
